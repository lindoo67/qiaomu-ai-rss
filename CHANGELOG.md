# Changelog

## 0.23.1

- Keep mobile podcast controls above Obsidian’s floating navigation bar, with touch-sized close and audio controls. Reclaim the extra space when navigation is hidden.
- Put note save-folder settings under Notes. Support the vault root, new nested folders, and a “Save note to…” action with an optional default location; preserve existing notes with numbered filenames.

## 0.23.0

- Appear on Qiaomu Home (乔木Home), the Obsidian start page, through the Qiaomu Home Protocol (version 1): the newest unread articles with the unread count, an "Add feed" quick action, and article search over local and saved articles. Opening an item from Home opens that article in the reader.
- Home reads only articles already on this device; it never triggers a feed refresh. Without Qiaomu Home nothing changes.

## 0.22.0

- Share the open article with Qiaomu Agent through the Qiaomu Context Protocol (read-only, version 1). The agent sees the article in the version being read (original, rewrite or translation) and can use it without saving Markdown first.
- When Qiaomu Agent is installed and enabled, the selection popup and the article context menu gain Ask AI (sparkles icon), which hands the article and the selected passage to the agent. Without the agent nothing changes: no extra button, no prompt to install.

## 0.21.0

- Localize the interface into eight languages that follow Obsidian's language setting: 简体中文, English, 繁體中文, 日本語, 한국어, Español, Français and Deutsch. Menus, dialogs, settings, notices, reading versions, font names and relative dates all translate; feed content, group names and note text stay as written.
- Enable identifier minification so the eight-language message tables fit the 5 MB release budget.

## 0.20.1

- Move podcast audio into a player bar at the bottom of the reader. It keeps playing with visible controls after returning to the list or switching channels; opening another article stops it, the episode title jumps back to the episode, and the close button stops playback. Embedded YouTube videos pause when the reader is hidden on narrow layouts.

## 0.20.0 — local development candidate

- Add Discover subscriptions with six editorial recommendations and WeChat, podcast and independent-blog catalogs.
- Search the bundled 718-source Tidings catalog and existing catalogs; preview feeds and recent episodes before following. Preserve discovery context after subscribing.
- Unify RSS, OPML imports, podcasts and vault paths in My subscriptions with stable groups, rename/reorder/delete, multi-select moves and safe unsubscribe.
- Import OPML from files, text or URLs with selectable searchable previews and duplicate protection. Support up to 2000 RSS subscriptions with bounded refresh batches.
- Restructure the channel picker into 乔木精选 (全部精选 plus built-in group filters such as 微信公众号 and 小宇宙 that merge their channels' latest articles) and 我的订阅 (全部订阅, reading a whole group in one click, expandable groups, ungrouped sources).
- Add a 管理订阅 button beside the picker search that opens the 订阅中心 dialog with 订阅管理 and 发现订阅 tabs: search, type/error filters, collapsible groups with select-all, sticky bulk actions (move, refresh, unsubscribe), per-feed refresh/copy URL, update status, OPML import/export and catalog discovery in one place. Retire the standalone Discover/My subscriptions tabs and close them when a saved workspace restores them.
- Merge the blog and "more" catalogs into 独立博客和其他 with URL and site/title deduplication. Merge alias groups such as Podcasts and 播客, and merge groups renamed onto an existing name.
- Simplify Discover: drop language/topic filters and the manual catalog update; the bundled catalog ships with plugin updates and provenance moves to a small footnote. Redesign 订阅管理 around one toolbar row (search, type filter, a single 添加 menu holding discovery, local content, new group and OPML import/export); quiet group labels with inline empty-group hints; framed source icons; per-source update time, unread count and read errors on the right, swapped for refresh and manage actions on hover; checkboxes revealed on hover or while selecting, with a bottom bulk-action bar. New local sources stay ungrouped instead of creating a 本地文件 group. Indent picker groups and sources below 全部精选/全部订阅.
- 全部精选 mixes each featured Xiaoyuzhou show's latest episode into the timeline by publish date instead of pinning them above newer articles; an episode older than the loaded page waits until older pages load.
- Fix the discovery panel staying on top after switching back to 订阅管理.
- The reader toolbar trades the font button for 存为笔记 (file-plus); once an article is saved in the current version the button becomes 打开已存笔记 (file-check) and the ⋯ menu offers 另存一份笔记. Saved-note links follow renames and folder moves. 阅读设置 moves to the top of the ⋯ menu.
- Save as Markdown writes straight into a vault folder (设置 → 保存与导出 → 文章保存文件夹, default `Qiaomu RSS/文章`) through Obsidian's vault API, so it also works on mobile; images follow Obsidian's attachment location and link style, repeat saves become `(2)`, and the notice links to the new note. PDF export keeps the system dialog but reopens where the last PDF was saved.
- Tighten the article list: hide the repeated source name inside a single channel, prefer cached Chinese rewrites for excerpts, drop WeChat bylines, hide untranslated excerpts under Chinese titles (titles get up to three lines), larger 12/13/15px meta, excerpt and title text, a gutter unread dot, and 56px thumbnails.
- Adopt a black, white and gray palette across the reader, dialogs, discovery, library and settings instead of Obsidian's purple accent; redesign the source preview dialog.
- Add cached source favicons with text fallback, source links on article headings, and compact mobile-compatible discovery and management.
- Preserve legacy data with a migration backup; keep personal subscriptions separate from editorial Qiaomu Picks.
